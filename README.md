Project Title: Data to Action: A Secondary School-Based Citizen Science Project to Address Arsenic Contamination of Well Water.

Overview
This project undertakes a critical investigation of well water samples collected from the states of Maine and New Hampshire, USA, focusing on arsenic contamination.

Objectives
Identify and summarize chemical components into a small number of subgroups.
Cluster well water samples into homogeneous groups based on their chemical compositions.
Compare chemical mixtures in well water samples with standard accepted values in well water (following USA standards).

Methodology
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify patterns within the multivariate data.
Cluster analysis techniques were utilized to categorize well water samples into homogeneous groups based on their compositional similarities.
